<h3>Integer Factorization</h3>
<p>
    Integer factorization is the process of breaking down a composite number into 
    its prime factors. It involves repeatedly dividing the number by prime numbers 
    until only primes remain. This process is fundamental in cryptography, mathematics, 
    and computer science, with applications such as RSA encryption.
