<p>
    This function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n. It employs a 
    brute-force approach by iteratively dividing n by increasing divisors starting from 2 until n becomes 1.
    This algorithm is not efficient and there are often better ways to find prime factors of a number.

<p>
    Fermat's factorization algorithm is an integer factorization method that exploits
    the property of a difference of squares. Given an odd integer \( n \), it finds two 
    factors \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( n = pq \). The algorithm works by searching for 
    integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a^2 - b^2 = n \), then \( n = (a + b)(a - b) \).
