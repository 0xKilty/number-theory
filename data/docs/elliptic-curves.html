        <a href="{{ point_addition }}" target="_blank">
            point_addition(P: tuple[int, int], Q: tuple[int, int], a: int, b: int) -> tuple[int, int]

    </code>
</h3>
<p>
    This function takes in \( P \) and \( Q \) as points and integers \( a \) and \( b \) as variables
    to the following equation.
</p>
<p>
    \(
        y^2=x^3+ax+b
    \)
</p> 
<p>
    Which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve" target="_blank">Weierstrass normal form</a>.
    \( P \) and \( Q \) are then the movable points on the graph below with the result being the blue point on the curve
    which is the addition between \( P \) and \( Q \) on the curve defined by \( a \) and \( b \).
