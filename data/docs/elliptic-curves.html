    This function takes in \( P \) and \( Q \) as points and integers \( a \) and \( b \) as variables
    to the following equation.

    \(
        y^2=x^3+ax+b
    \)
</p> 
<p>
    Which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve" target="_blank">Weierstrass normal form</a>.
    \( P \) and \( Q \) are then the movable points on the graph below with the result being the green point on the curve
    which is the addition between \( P \) and \( Q \) on the curve defined by \( a \) and \( b \).

    </code>
</h3>
<p>
    \( P \) is a point on the curve defined by \( a \) and \( b \) as variables in the equation \( y^2=x^3+ax+b \).
    The scalar defined by \( k \) is applied to \( P \) using the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication#Double-and-add" target="_blank">double-and-add</a> method.
    For the double-and-add method, \( Q \) is also defined to be a point at infinity.
    The algorithm is defined as if the integer \( k \) is even, add \( P \) to itself, then divide \( k \) by 2, and if
    \( k \) is odd, then add \( P \) to \( Q \). Once \( k \) reaches 0, then the algorithm terminates.

<p>
   \( P \) and \( Q \) are unique points on the curve defined by the variables \( a \) and \( b \) in the equation \( y^2=x^3+ax+b \)
   which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve" target="_blank">Weierstrass normal form</a>.
   \( mod \) is then the modulus that the computation takes place in to in the finite field \( \mathbb{F}_{mod} \).
